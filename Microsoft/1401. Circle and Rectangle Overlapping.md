# Circle and Rectangle Overlapping

The side of the rectangle touches or intersects the circle. In order to check whether the shapes intersect, we need to find a point on or inside the rectangle that is closest to the center of the circle. If this point lies on or inside the circle, it is guaranteed that both the shapes intersect. Let the closest point be denoted by (Xn, Yn). Then the distance between the closest point and the center of the circle can be found using sqrt((Xc- Xn)2 + (Yc- Yn)2). If this distance ? the radius of the circle, the two shapes intersect

### Sample Input
```
radius = 1, xCenter = 0, yCenter = 0, x1 = 1, y1 = -1, x2 = 3, y2 = 1
```
### Sample Output
```
true

Explanation: Circle and rectangle share the point (1,0).
```

### Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkOverlap(int radius, int xCenter, int yCenter, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        int xn=max(x1,min(xCenter,x2));
        int yn=max(y1,min(yCenter,y2));

        int Dx=xCenter-xn;
        int Dy=yCenter-yn;
        int val = sqrt(Dx*Dx + Dy*Dy);
        if(val<=radius){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
